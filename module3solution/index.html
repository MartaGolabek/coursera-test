Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width
of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and
mobile. To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set
its height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be
required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is set to distinguish
it from the rest of the content. ( Hint: don’t forget to have an element with a class=’container’ or
class=’containerfluid’
wrapping your grid. Remember that to have the grid do something
“always”, i.e., no matter what browser window size, use the colxs...Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width
